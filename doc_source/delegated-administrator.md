# Register a delegated administrator<a name="delegated-administrator"></a>

 You can delegate a member account from your organization to perform administrative tasks, such as sharing license configurations with other member accounts, performing cross\-account resource discovery, and distributing managed entitlements to other member accounts\. Only member accounts that are part of your AWS Organizations can be registered as a delegated administrator\. For more information about joining an organization, see [Inviting an AWS account to join your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html)\.

Your can register one delegated administrator per organization\. Before you register a delegated administrator, you must enable trusted access with AWS Organizations\.
